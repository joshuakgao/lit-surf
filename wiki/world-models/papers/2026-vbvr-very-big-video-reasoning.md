## Summary

VBVR (Very Big Video Reasoning) introduces an unprecedented 2.015M-sample dataset for large-scale world reasoning research, grounded in cognitive science theory. The dataset spans 200 curated tasks organized around five foundational cognitive capabilities: Abstraction, Knowledge, Spatiality, Perception, and Transformation. Alongside the dataset, VBVR-Bench provides a verifiable evaluation framework using rule-based scorers and human-aligned metrics rather than VLM judges, enabling reproducible diagnosis of world reasoning capabilities. A large-scale scaling study reveals early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, establishing a foundation for systematic research into video as a substrate for understanding world dynamics—not just visual realism.

## Key contributions

- **Unprecedented dataset scale**: 2.015M images, 1.007M video clips; ~1000× larger than existing world reasoning benchmarks (prior max: 12.8K samples)
- **Cognitive architecture taxonomy**: 5 foundational faculties (Abstraction, Knowledge, Spatiality, Perception, Transformation) grounded in human cognitive science theory
- **Systematic task design**: 200 diverse, community-contributed tasks with unified input/output templates; ensures diversity while maintaining consistency for scaling
- **Verifiable evaluation framework**: VBVR-Bench enforces rule-based scorers + human alignment over VLM-as-judge paradigms; enables interpretable, reproducible diagnosis
- **Scaling behavior findings**: Large-scale empirical study demonstrates emergent generalization—models improve on unseen reasoning tasks with more training data

## Method

**Dataset pipeline:**
1. **Task specification**: 50+ researchers contribute reasoning task semantics across five cognitive capabilities
2. **Template standardization**: Unified input/output specification (questions, video, answers) without constraining task design
3. **Expert quality control**: Human inspection ensures task correctness before automated processing
4. **Scalable generation**: Cloud-based automated pipeline generates randomized training examples per task; easily extends to new tasks

**Cognitive capability framework:**
- **Spatiality**: spatial relationships, layout reasoning, object localization
- **Transformation**: object motion, state changes, visual dynamics
- **Knowledge**: semantic understanding, real-world reasoning, commonsense
- **Abstraction**: generalization, categorization, pattern extraction
- **Perception**: visual detail, fine-grained discrimination, sensory reasoning

**Evaluation:**
- VBVR-Bench: rule-based scorers for each task type, human-aligned metrics
- Verifiable scoring eliminates model-judging ambiguity
- In-domain and out-of-domain evaluation tracks generalization

## Results

**Scale comparison:**
- VBVR-Dataset: 2.015M samples (with 1M train / 7.5K test split)
- Prior largest dataset: ~12.8K samples combined across 9 existing benchmarks
- 155× scale advantage

**Scaling behavior:**
- In-domain: 0.974 Parikh score (near human); strong improvement from 50K to 200K training data
- Out-of-domain: 0.610 score; demonstrates non-trivial generalization gap but emergent unseen-task capability
- Early signs of emerging generalization on novel reasoning patterns

**Benchmark performance:**
- Five-capability radar chart shows relative model strength across cognitive faculties
- Enables diagnosis of specific reasoning bottlenecks (e.g., Spatiality vs. Abstraction)

## Relation to prior work

Complements recent work on reasoning and world models (Wiedemer et al. 2025, Tong et al. 2025, Guo et al. 2025, Garrido et al. 2025) by providing the first **large-scale training dataset** for world reasoning at scale. While prior work has evaluated video generation models' reasoning and physics abilities in zero-shot settings, VBVR enables **supervised training studies** at scale, analogous to how large language model datasets enabled scaling laws. The [[2025-intuitive-physics-self-supervised-pretraining|V-JEPA physics paper]] demonstrates *how* physics understanding emerges from representation learning; VBVR provides a comprehensive benchmark to *measure* what world reasoning capabilities emerge from training.

## Open questions / limitations

- **Generalization to real video**: Most tasks are synthetic or curated; robustness on in-the-wild video reasoning not extensively evaluated
- **Task distribution bias**: Despite community contribution, coverage of all reasoning modalities may be uneven; some cognitive capabilities may have fewer exemplars
- **Scaling laws extrapolation**: Do trends observed at 2M samples continue to 10B+ samples? Extrapolation beyond current scale unclear
- **Human baseline variation**: Human baseline (0.974 in-domain) assumes "easy" task definitions; harder out-of-domain tasks may require richer reasoning
- **Model architecture design**: Scaling study uses primarily generation models (Veo, Sora); how discriminative and other architectures scale remains open
- **Long-horizon reasoning**: Current tasks may emphasize short-range spatiotemporal reasoning; multi-step causal chains over extended video remains underexplored
- **Integration with physics**: How VBVR's task-based reasoning integrates with V-JEPA's emergent physics understanding is unexplored
