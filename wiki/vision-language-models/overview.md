# Vision-Language Models — Overview

*Last updated: 2026-04-07 | Sources: 24 papers*

## Current thesis

Vision-language models are experiencing rapid capability expansion across four dimensions: **modality coverage** (from images to video, audio, 3D, thermal), **task breadth** (from understanding to generation and reasoning), **spatial precision** (from global to pixel-level and region-level), and **scale** (from single images to long-context multi-modal reasoning). The field has transitioned from specialized models (image captioning, VQA) toward unified foundation models capable of diverse downstream tasks. Current frontiers: hallucination reduction, structured reasoning (step-by-step VLM), domain specialization (biology, 3D shapes), and efficiency. The dominant paradigm: freeze powerful foundation models (CLIP, LLM, diffusion) and learn lightweight adapters/mappings, enabling rapid capability scaling with minimal training cost.

## Key trends

**2021 — Foundation: Lightweight Bridging**
- [[papers/2021-clipcap-clip-prefix-image-captioning|ClipCap]] introduces prefix-tuning — a minimal trainable layer bridging frozen CLIP and frozen GPT-2. Core insight: powerful pre-trained models can be composed via learned mappings, not full finetuning. Sets the template for parameter-efficient VLM training.

**2023 — Expansion: Multimodality & Instruction Tuning**
- **Instruction tuning emerges as the dominant training paradigm.** [[papers/2023-improved-llava-visual-instruction-tuning|LLaVA-1.5]] systematically studies design choices and demonstrates that simple architectural improvements (MLP connectors, higher resolution) + instruction-following data yields SOTA generalist VLM.
- **Any-to-any modality becomes a goal.** [[papers/2023-nextgpt-any-to-any-multimodal|NExT-GPT]] and [[papers/2023-imagebind-one-embedding-space|ImageBind]] pursue unified multimodal spaces. ImageBind's key innovation: a single embedding space for text, image, video, audio, depth, thermal, egocentric — enabling cross-modal retrieval and reasoning.
- **Generation becomes native to VLMs.** [[papers/2023-gill-generating-images-multimodal|GILL]] demonstrates LLM-to-diffusion mapping, enabling text+image conditioned image generation within a dialogue system; first to support arbitrary image-text interleaving.
- **Survey work consolidates the field.** [[papers/2023-vision-language-models-vision-tasks-survey|VLM survey]] catalogs training paradigms (contrastive, generative, alignment), downstream tasks (VQA, captioning, grounding), and benchmarks.

**2024 — Specialization: Spatial Precision & Domain Focus**
- **Pixel-level grounding becomes accessible.** [[papers/2024-glamm-pixel-grounding-multimodal|GLaMM]] and [[papers/2024-lisa-reasoning-segmentation|LISA]] integrate segmentation into VLMs via SAM or embedding-as-mask, enabling pixel-level grounding, region captioning, and phrase grounding in a unified model. [[papers/2024-llm-seg-bridging-segmentation-language|LLM-Seg]] further shows LLMs can select among mask proposals from specialized models.
- **Unified task representation emerges.** [[papers/2024-florence2-unified-vision-tasks|Florence-2]] demonstrates that a single VLM can handle classification, detection, segmentation, captioning, grounding, OCR via task-specific prompt formatting. Challenges the specialization trend; shows one architecture suffices for diverse tasks.
- **Domain specialization accelerates.** [[papers/2024-bioclip-vision-foundation-tree-of-life|BioCLIP]] finetunes CLIP for all 454K biological species; [[papers/2024-bodyshapegpt-3d-body-shape-manipulation|BodyShapeGPT]] applies LLMs to 3D body shape manipulation. Signals that VLM+domain data can rapidly bootstrap specialized experts.
- **Quality assessment and agentic methods emerge.** [[papers/2024-seagull-image-quality-assessment-roi|SEAGULL]] shows VLMs can assess image quality at region level. [[papers/2024-genartist-multimodal-llm-generation-editing|GenArtist]] positions VLMs as agents for image editing and self-correction.

**2025 — Maturation: Reasoning, Hallucination, Scale**
- **Step-by-step visual reasoning becomes explicit.** [[papers/2025-llamav-o1-step-by-step-visual-reasoning|LlamaV-o1]] applies chain-of-thought reasoning to visual tasks, showing intermediate reasoning steps improve complex visual understanding.
- **Hallucination reduction becomes urgent.** [[papers/2025-skip-newline-reduce-hallucination|SKIP \\N]] and [[papers/2025-latent-space-steering-reduce-hallucinations|VTI]] tackle hallucination via prompt engineering and latent space steering. SKIP \\N's finding (newlines correlate with hallucinations) reveals unexpected model behavior. VTI's approach (precomputed feature vectors) offers inference-time intervention without retraining.
- **Localized understanding reaches maturity.** [[papers/2025-describe-anything-detailed-localized-captioning|Describe Anything]] demonstrates detailed multi-sentence region captioning with focal prompts and SSL data pipelines, closing the localization gap that plagued earlier VLMs.
- **Structured understanding for 3D scenes.** [[papers/2025-spatiallm-llm-structured-indoor-modeling|SpatialLM]] applies LLMs to 3D reconstruction from scene descriptions, bridging language understanding and 3D structure.
- **Large-scale integration.** [[papers/2025-internvl-large-vision-language-model|InternVL]] demonstrates that scaling VLM parameters and data yields consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks.

**Evolution summary**: Lightweight bridging (2021) → instruction-tuned generalists (2023) → spatial+domain specialization (2024) → reasoning, hallucination mitigation, and 3D understanding (2025). Each phase adds capability while maintaining parameter efficiency through adapter/mapping paradigms.

## Open problems

### Hallucination and reliability
- How to reliably detect when a VLM is hallucinating vs. reasoning from genuine visual content?
- Can hallucinations be eliminated, or are they inherent to the scaling laws of LLMs?
- How to quantify hallucination types (object, attribute, spatial, relational)?

### Spatial precision and grounding
- Pixel-level grounding requires SAM or dense segmentation models; can VLMs generate fine-grained spatial understanding end-to-end without specialized modules?
- How to handle partial occlusions and ambiguous spatial relationships in grounding?
- Can region-level understanding scale to dense pixel labeling (panoptic segmentation)?

### Long-context reasoning
- MMLongBench (2025) establishes that long-context VLM performance plateaus or degrades; is this fundamental or a training limitation?
- How does reasoning capability scale with sequence length (8K to 128K+ tokens)?
- Can VLMs maintain consistency and coherence over hundreds of images?

### Multimodal alignment and generation
- ImageBind unified text/image/audio/video/depth; can this space handle egocentric, thermal, and other modalities equally well?
- Generation fidelity: image generation from VLMs still lags specialized diffusion models; can this gap close via better LLM-to-generation mapping?
- Can VLMs generate structured outputs (3D meshes, CAD models) reliably?

### Generalization and domain transfer
- VLMs pretrained on web data; do they transfer to specialized domains (medical, legal, scientific) without finetuning?
- How much domain data is sufficient to adapt a general VLM (cf. BioCLIP's 10M biological images)?
- Can prompt engineering alone achieve domain-specific performance, or is finetuning necessary?

### Reasoning and planning
- LlamaV-o1 adds reasoning steps; does intermediate reasoning improve all visual tasks or only complex/ambiguous ones?
- How to balance reasoning depth (number of steps) with computational cost?
- Can VLMs support true multi-step planning (e.g., tool-use sequences) like their text-only LLM counterparts?

## Contradictions and debates

- **Generalists vs. specialists:** Florence-2 shows a single model handles diverse tasks well; yet BioCLIP and domain-specific models outperform general models on specialized benchmarks. Likely both approaches coexist: general models for broad capability, specialists for highest accuracy.
- **Unified multimodal spaces vs. specialized encoders:** ImageBind advocates single embedding space for all modalities. In practice, separate encoders (vision, audio, text) finetuned to align seem equally viable and sometimes superior. Unclear if true unification is necessary.
- **Scale vs. efficiency:** InternVL, LLaVA-1.5 show that careful design + modest scale beats large models. Tension between scaling laws (bigger is better) and practical deployment (efficiency matters). Likely resolution: smaller specialized models for inference, large models for pretraining.
- **Frozen vs. finetuned foundations:** ClipCap, LLaVA maintain frozen CLIP/LLM; others finetune vision encoders. Frozen approach saves compute but may leave capability on table; full finetuning risks catastrophic forgetting. Adapter-based finetuning (LoRA, prefix-tuning) offers middle ground.
