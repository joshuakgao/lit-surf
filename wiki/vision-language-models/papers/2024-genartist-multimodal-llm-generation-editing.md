## Summary

GenArtist reimagines image generation and editing as an agent problem, using a multimodal LLM as an "artist" that decomposes complex user requirements into simpler sub-problems, plans operations, executes them through tool invocation, and performs verification and self-correction. Rather than relying on a single specialized model, GenArtist coordinates diverse existing generation and editing models through LLM reasoning. For complex problems, the MLLM decomposes them into a tree-structured plan with step-by-step verification and correction mechanisms, enabling handling of intricate text prompts and complex editing requirements that individual models struggle with. The system integrates a comprehensive tool library and leverages the agent's reasoning for tool selection and execution, achieving greater accuracy than SDXL and DALL-E 3 on text-to-image generation and excelling at complex image editing tasks.

## Key contributions

- Introduces agent-based framework for image generation/editing with LLM-driven planning and reasoning
- Proposes tree-structured decomposition of complex generation tasks into verifiable sub-operations
- Integrates verification and self-correction mechanisms for reliable image generation
- Achieves superior performance to SDXL and DALL-E 3 on complex generation tasks

## Method

MLLM agent framework with planning, tool selection, execution, and verification stages. For complex problems, constructs tree-structured plans decomposing tasks into simpler components with step-by-step verification.

## Results

Superior performance on complex text-to-image generation compared to SDXL and DALL-E 3, and excellent results on image editing tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and modification.

## Relation to prior work

Extends vision-language models to agent-based reasoning for creative tasks, building on instruction-tuning approaches while introducing planning and verification mechanisms inspired by reasoning in language models.

## Open questions / limitations

Approach depends on quality of underlying generation models; limited to current tool library. Computational cost of planning and verification stages may be significant. Evaluation on subjective quality metrics of generated images limited compared to automatic metrics.
