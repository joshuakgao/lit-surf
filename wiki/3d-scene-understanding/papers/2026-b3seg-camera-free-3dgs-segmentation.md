## Summary

B³-Seg addresses interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) segmentation under practical constraints: no predefined camera viewpoints, no ground-truth labels, and results in seconds. The core innovation is reformulating segmentation as sequential Beta–Bernoulli Bayesian updates, where the model maintains posterior distributions over per-Gaussian object labels and actively selects the next best view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG). The method integrates 2D foundation models (Grounding DINO + SAM2 with CLIP re-ranking) and updates 3D labels through Bayesian aggregation. This approach is both theoretically grounded—with provable (1−1/e) greedy approximation guarantees for view selection—and practically fast, completing segmentation in seconds rather than minutes.

## Key contributions

- **Camera-free, training-free, fast segmentation**: Achieves open-vocabulary 3DGS segmentation in seconds without camera paths, ground-truth labels, or retraining.
- **Bayesian reformulation**: Reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta–Bernoulli updates, enabling principled probabilistic fusion across views.
- **Analytic active view selection**: Derives closed-form Expected Information Gain and proves adaptive monotonicity and adaptive submodularity, guaranteeing greedy optimality.
- **Theoretical guarantees**: Non-negativity and diminishing returns of EIG confirmed, leading to provable (1−1/e) approximation to optimal view sampling.
- **Practical accuracy**: Competitive with slower, label-dependent methods while preserving practical constraints.

## Method

**Segmentation as Bayesian updates:**
- Each Gaussian in the 3DGS representation has a latent object label.
- Observations from actively selected views are obtained using Grounding DINO + SAM2 (provides 2D masks) and CLIP (provides re-ranking confidence).
- Per-Gaussian object labels are modeled as Beta–Bernoulli posteriors, updated via Bayesian aggregation across views.

**Active view selection via EIG:**
- On each selected view, the model computes per-Gaussian pseudo-counts (likelihood of object presence) from the 2D mask.
- Expected Information Gain is computed analytically for candidate views, measuring how much each view would reduce posterior uncertainty.
- The view with maximum EIG is selected greedily, ensuring (1−1/e) approximation to optimal sampling under the monotonicity and submodularity properties.

**Architecture:**
- Grounding DINO: open-vocabulary 2D detection and localization.
- SAM2: segmentation masks from detected objects.
- CLIP: semantic re-ranking of masks.
- Beta–Bernoulli Bayesian updates: aggregation across views.

## Results

Experiments on multiple datasets (unnamed in abstract, but typical 3DGS benchmarks) show that B³-Seg achieves:
- Competitive segmentation accuracy with supervised methods that rely on camera viewpoints and ground-truth labels.
- Completion time in seconds (vs. minutes to tens of minutes for baseline methods).
- No requirement for predefined views or semantic ground-truth masks.
- Monotonic information gain with each selected view.

## Relation to prior work

Builds on recent open-vocabulary 3DGS segmentation work (e.g., methods by referenced papers [18, 19, 28, 29, 34]) but removes the dependency on predefined camera paths and ground-truth labels that limit practical use. Improves on few-second baselines (FlashSplat, COB-GS) by adding theoretical guarantees and Bayesian principled fusion. Integrates the strongest 2D foundation models (Grounding DINO, SAM2, CLIP) available at 2026.

## Open questions / limitations

- **Scalability to large scenes**: Performance on very large-scale scenes with thousands of objects not explicitly evaluated.
- **Robustness to viewpoint clusters**: How gracefully does the method degrade if all selected views cluster in similar spatial regions?
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: How sensitive is view selection to the prior on Beta–Bernoulli parameters?
- **Failure modes of 2D detectors**: Reliance on Grounding DINO and SAM2 means segmentation quality is bounded by 2D foundation model performance; failure cases not deeply analyzed.
- **Interactive feedback**: No user-in-the-loop refinement mechanism described; all updates are algorithmic.
