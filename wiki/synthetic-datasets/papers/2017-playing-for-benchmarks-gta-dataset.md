## Summary

This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark suite for visual perception based on Grand Theft Auto V, containing 254,064 fully-annotated video frames collected while driving, riding, and walking 184 km in diverse environmental conditions (day, night, rain, snow). The benchmark addresses multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously: semantic segmentation, semantic instance segmentation, object detection and tracking, 3D scene layout, visual odometry, and optical flow—all with ground truth available for every frame. The key innovation is a novel methodology for extracting ground truth from game engines without access to source code or content, using middleware injection, dynamic shader modification via bytecode rewriting, and bytecode analysis to enable video-rate collection of dense pixel-accurate correspondences and instance-level 3D layouts. The benchmark combines characteristics of prior datasets (KITTI's multi-task evaluation, Cityscapes' semantic segmentation quality, and Oxford RobotCar's diverse conditions) while extending them with comprehensive temporal consistency and video-rate annotations.

## Key contributions

- **Comprehensive multi-task benchmark**: Single dataset with ground truth for both low-level (optical flow, visual odometry) and high-level (instance segmentation, tracking, 3D layout) tasks
- **Novel data extraction methodology**: First to enable video-rate ground truth capture from game engines without source code access via middleware, shader manipulation, and bytecode rewriting
- **Temporal consistency**: Object-level semantic ground truth and instance tracking across entire video sequences
- **Diverse conditions**: Data collected in day, night, rain, and snow environments, addressing robustness requirements
- **Scale and density**: 254,064 frames with dense per-pixel annotations and subpixel-accurate correspondences
- **Realism validation**: Statistical analyses show scene composition matches real urban environments; perceptual experiments validate realism

## Method

**Data collection from game engine**:

**Middleware-based extraction**:
- Inject middleware between game and graphics library via detouring
- Capture rendering commands at video rate without accessing game source code
- Operates on bytecode level for shader manipulation (no source code needed)

**Shader slicing and bytecode rewriting**:
- Augment pixel shaders at runtime using dynamic software updating
- Identify unused shader inputs/outputs and inject resource IDs, depth, transparency values
- Use bytecode rewriting (originally developed for Java) to modify shader bytecode
- Enable tagging each pixel with resource IDs and depth values in real-time

**Ground truth synthesis**:

1. **Semantic segmentation**: Track rendering resources that correlate with semantic classes; segment pixels by resource usage
2. **Instance segmentation**: Cluster patches by transformation matrices (objects share matrices); aggregate semantic labels via majority voting
3. **3D scene layout**: Record meshes, vertex buffers, and transformation matrices; compute 3D bounding boxes in camera reference frame
4. **Visual odometry**: Recover camera position from transformation matrices
5. **Optical flow & Tracking**: Associate meshes across frames using weighted matching problem; handle mesh appearance/disappearance and level-of-detail changes

**Object tracking formulation**:
- Define weighted matching graph between meshes in consecutive frames
- Weights based on position distance, semantic class consistency, segment ID continuity, and class-dependent speed limits
- Ensures temporally consistent instance tracking even with dynamic object replacement/level-of-detail changes

## Results

**Benchmark characteristics**:
- 254,064 fully-annotated video frames
- 184 km of continuous video sequences (driving, riding, walking)
- Multiple environmental conditions: day, night, rain, snow
- Dense annotations: semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, 3D bounding boxes, optical flow, visual odometry, tracking

**Validation**:
- Statistical analysis shows scene composition matches real urban environments
- Perceptual experiments validate photorealism and realism of rendered content
- Baseline evaluations of state-of-the-art methods for multiple tasks

**Challenges identified**:
- Reveals limitations of existing methods across multiple tasks
- Creates opportunities for multi-task and end-to-end learning research
- Temporal consistency and diverse conditions pose challenges for current approaches

## Relation to prior work

This work builds on prior benchmarks (KITTI for multi-task video, Cityscapes for semantic segmentation quality, Oxford RobotCar for diverse conditions) but combines all characteristics in a single large-scale dataset for the first time. The data extraction methodology significantly advances [[synthetic-dataset|synthetic dataset generation]] by enabling video-rate collection without source code access, going beyond prior work (e.g., [52]) that was limited to frame-by-frame annotation of semantic segmentation. The focus on temporal consistency and object tracking across video sequences is novel and important for autonomous driving and robotics applications.

## Open questions / limitations

- How well do models trained on GTA V transfer to real-world urban perception tasks?
- Can the methodology be extended to other game engines or virtual environments?
- How does synthetic content bias (GTA V's specific aesthetic/content choices) affect learned representations?
- Can the framework scale to even larger-scale game worlds or longer continuous sequences?
- How sensitive are results to different environmental conditions within the synthetic world (e.g., time of day, weather)?
