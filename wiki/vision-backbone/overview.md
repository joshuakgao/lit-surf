# Vision Backbone — Overview

*Last updated: 2026-04-10 | Sources: 1 paper*

## Current thesis

Self-supervised Vision Transformers can learn rich, transferable visual representations without labels. The DINO method demonstrates that this approach produces features that are competitive with supervised pretraining and enable strong zero-shot performance on diverse downstream tasks including segmentation, detection, and depth prediction.

## Key trends

**2021 — Emergence of self-supervised ViTs**: DINO shows that Vision Transformers excel at self-supervised learning and learn semantically meaningful features with emergent object segmentation properties—a capability less natural in CNNs. This opens the door to large-scale unsupervised pretraining as a path to foundation models.

## Open problems

- How do self-supervised features scale with model size and dataset diversity?
- Can emergent properties (segmentation, localization) be made more robust and fine-grained?
- What is the relationship between model capacity, pretraining data scale, and downstream task performance?
- How do self-supervised backbones compare to multi-task or contrastive baselines?

## Contradictions and debates

(None yet; awaiting DINOv2/v3 to assess field evolution)
